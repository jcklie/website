### Book Review: Murder on the Orient Express



---

**_SPOILER ALERT! The book review may reveal key plots_**

Famed crime novelist Agatha Christie published the classic _Murder on the Orient Express_ in 1934. It is set on the Orient express on its journey from Vienna to Istanbul.

One day, a passenger is found dead, stabbed 12 times. The train is stalled by heavy snowdrift, and the renowned Belgian detective Hercule Poirot's trip is interrupted to investigate the case. The victim Ratchett turns out to be a cruel villain named Cassetti, who kidnapped a little girl called Daisy Armstrong a few years ago, collected an enormous sum of ransom but killed the child anyway. Although later arrested, he was able to tamper with the trial and flee the country. People closely connected with the Armstrong family suffered gravely from the tragedy, so they could not tolerate the acquittal. A self-appointed jury consisting of those people condemned Cassetti to death and execute him on the Orient Express, each stabbing him once. They back alibis for each other, and Poirot is tasked with unwinding the maze of deception. When Poirot discovers that the passengers have collaborated to ensure Cassetti’s death, and that their motive is taking revenge for the Armstrong family, he is compelled by his sense of justice to shield the conspirators and propose an alternative possible solution to the case: a stranger has somehow gained access to the train and murdered Cassetti.

In this “whodunit” Agatha Christie explores the gap between legal justice and moral justice. Through Poirot’s covering up for the murderers, Christie indicates her consent that the revenge is ultimately an act of moral justice. At first glance, murdering Cassetti seems beyond reproach. It is the verdict’s failure to meet people's expectations of justice that leads to the murder on the Orient Express. When someone commits a crime and escapes the legal punishment using despicable means, what else is there to do for those who want to uphold justice other than taking retaliatory measures? Such notion can be seen in the Bible and some ancient Codes.

> “Have no pity; let life be given for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot (Deu 19:21).”

> “If a man knocks out the teeth of his equal, his teeth shall be knocked out (Code of Hammurabi).”

In this sense, Poirot’s decision is understandable, if not unimpeachable.

However, as a person living in a law-governed society where violent private remedy is generally considered uncivilized (Hu, 2017), I cannot help but ponder whether revenge can serve as a substitute when the law is absent and whether it is justified that people take the law into their own hands. As the saying goes, reprisal breeds reprisal. Poirot leaves the passengers free from suspicion, nevertheless, who can guarantee that they will never encounter further vindictiveness? What if Cassetti’s family and friends (if there are any) find out about the truth and in turn wreak vengeance on them? Once the law of the jungle prevails in society, the credibility of the state’s judiciary and the security of the people are in jeopardy (Gan, 2018). Such chaos and anarchy can only be brought under control by the legal system, which blocks or at least cushions the direct confrontation between the two sides by proposing a pacifying solution - in Cassetti’s case, death penalty. While the outcome is identical, the trial is indispensable. It seems true to many that the vicious victim deserves death long ago to pay for his heinous misdeeds had he not been illegitimately acquitted, but I don’t think his death is for ordinary people to judge. Just as Gandalf once said to Frodo:

> “Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.” (Tolkien, 1954)

To side with moral justice or legal justice, is a dilemma. I assume that Poirot must have gone through tough inner struggle before bending the truth. Intellectually, I have no doubt that no one can flout the law with impunity; emotionally, I would have done the same thing if I were the detective. Fortunately, the paradox is not so intractable as it appears to be. When the legislature legislates against corruption and the court pronounces justified judgement in the first place, many seemingly difficult problems can be satisfyingly solved. To quote our constitution, 

> “a country is required to enforce laws strictly, administer justice impartially, ensure that everyone abides by the law and that all are equal before the law.” 

That we should strive to make legal justice consistent with moral justice is what this novel taught me, and I hope it continues to enlighten generations of readers.
